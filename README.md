Sales Performance Data Analysis Dashboard 📊
Project Overview
oject presents a dynamic and insightful Sales Performance Dashboard developed using
Power
The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by meticulouslyeaning and modeling the data using
Power Query
and applying a professional, custom design
.created in
Figma
ashboard provides a holistic view of sales operations, allowing users to track key performanceators (KPIs), analyze trends, and monitor performance across different territories and product.categories
Description
shboard is an interactive analysis tool built to monitor, measure, and optimize sales operationson the provided dataset. We used
Power Query
to perform rigorous data cleaning—includingng status codes, date transformations, and ensuring data integrity—before constructing a starchema model in Power BI. The visualization layer leverages a custom, professional backgroundned in
Figma
to ensure maximum readability and a clean aesthetic. Key analysis pillars include
Total Revenue
,
Profitability
, and deep dives into performance by
Geographical Territory
and
.
Product Category
