📊 Sales Performance Data Analysis DashboardProject OverviewThis project presents a dynamic and insightful Sales Performance Dashboard developed using Power BI. The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by meticulously cleaning and modeling the data using Power Query and applying a professional, custom design created in Figma.The dashboard provides a holistic view of sales operations, allowing users to track key performance indicators (KPIs), analyze trends, and monitor performance across different territories and product categories.DescriptionThis dashboard is an interactive analysis tool built to monitor, measure, and optimize sales operations based on the provided dataset. We used Power Query to perform rigorous data cleaning—including handling status codes, date transformations, and ensuring data integrity—before constructing a star schema model in Power BI. The visualization layer leverages a custom, professional background designed in Figma to ensure maximum readability and a clean aesthetic. Key analysis pillars include tracking Total Revenue, Profitability, and deep dives into performance by Geographical Territory and Product Category.Key Features & MetricsThe dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions and focuses on the following key areas and metrics:Sales Totals: Overall revenue and profitability analysis.Order Tracking: Status distribution (e.g., Shipped, Approved).Geographical Performance: Sales breakdown by Territory and Territory Group.Product Analysis: Performance of different Product Categories and Subcategories.Time-based Trends: Month-over-month or Year-over-Year sales comparisons.Technology StackToolPurposePower BI DesktopCore platform for data modeling, visualization, and dashboard creation.Power Query (M Language)Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
