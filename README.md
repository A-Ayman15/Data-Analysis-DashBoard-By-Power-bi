Sales Performance Data Analysis Dashboard 📊
Project Overview
oject presents a dynamic and insightful Sales Performance Dashboard developed using Power
The goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence by meticulously
eaning and modeling the data using Power Query and applying a professional, custom design
.created in Figma
ashboard provides a holistic view of sales operations, allowing users to track key performance
ators (KPIs), analyze trends, and monitor performance across different territories and product
.categories
Description
shboard is an interactive analysis tool built to monitor, measure, and optimize sales operations
on the provided dataset. We used Power Query to perform rigorous data cleaning—including
ng status codes, date transformations, and ensuring data integrity—before constructing a star
chema model in Power BI. The visualization layer leverages a custom, professional background
ned in Figma to ensure maximum readability and a clean aesthetic. Key analysis pillars include
Total Revenue, Profitability, and deep dives into performance by Geographical Territory and
.Product Category
Key Features & Metrics
dashboard is designed to answer critical business questions and focuses on the following key
:areas and metrics
.Sales Totals: Overall revenue and profitability analysis
.Order Tracking: Status distribution (e.g., Shipped, Approved)
.Geographical Performance: Sales breakdown by Territory and Territory Group
.Product Analysis: Performance of different Product Categories and Subcategories
.Time-based Trends: Month-over-month or Year-over-Year sales comparisons
